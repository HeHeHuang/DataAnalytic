### Data Type:

there are two type of date: 

numerical and cateogirical 

in the numerical: 

continous and discrete

in catergeorical data type: Norminal and oridinial 







### Hypothesis:(signification Hypothoesis Testin)

we have hypothesis first and assume the H0 is correct, we try to use the **sample statistics** to find out the **P value**. the p- value is the probability of small probabity event. if the small probability event happened, we can reject the H0, if not we accpet.



Type 1 & Type 2 Error:



parameter hypothesis testing 

##### T Test: 

##### indenpent T test

use to the sample size < 30 and the SD of populuation is unknown.

independt T Test: the weight of people who smoke is different. 

H0: the mean of people smoke = the mean of general people

##### Paired T test:

one indenpent variable(two categories) with one dependent variable(continuous value)

for example:  find out weight of male and female is statistically signification.

H0: the weitht of male and that of femal is no different 



##### Chi Square Test:

two categories variable 



##### Anova:

mulitple categories with on dependent variable(continuous value)



##### Permutation Test

user for the data is from unknow distribution
